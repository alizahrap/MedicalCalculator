Medical Calculator App 

My name is Sandy and I'm a pharmacist who develops iOS apps. I created this Medical Calculator App for my own use during clinical chart reviews. This app comes with a creatinine clearance calculator, english bmi calculator, metric bmi calculator, and drug shortage repository. The drug shortage repository uses Firebase to store and pull data from.
